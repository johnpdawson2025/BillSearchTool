# BillSearchTool
This is a tool using C# .NET 8.0 to allow the user (through use of a GUI) to select a formatted .csv file of legislation and search it for specific criteria (Title, Keywords, Authors, Cosponsors, etc.)
It formats the UI through Windows.Forms and outputs a separate .csv file "Search_Results.csv", enabling the user to either re-search or upload to Excel/Google Sheets at will.
