For: District 7 (Senator Larson) Senate Office, Wisconsin State Legislature
Approval by Legislative Technical Services Bureau (LTSB): Pending

Summary:
Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) so the user can search a comma-separated values (.csv) file of formatted legislation via this format:
[Title, Description, Keywords, Legislative Session, Senate Cosponsors/Introducing Committee, Representatives, Committee]
by selecting it and output a separate new "Search_Results.csv" file containing all pieces of legislation that match the search criteria:
[Title, Keywords, Senate Cosponsors/Introducing Committee, Representative Cosponsors, Senate Author, Representative Author, Committee]
as entered within the user interface by the user. A small dialog box displays the file path of the output "Search_Results.csv" and (unless specified to go to a different path by the user) will overwrite the previous "Search_Results.csv" This "Search_Results.csv" file can be renamed and/or uploaded to Excel/Google Sheets for further processing, and to avoid being overwritten.

Potential Bugs:
This is a project by an undergraduate non-computer-science student, so bugs may exist.
